<summary><strong>Architecture Explanation</strong> (click to expand)</summary>

- **User (Browser):** Accesses GearGrid via a modern web browser.
- **Frontend (React.js + Tailwind CSS):**  
  - Served as a static site (via Vercel).
  - Communicates securely with the backend API using HTTPS and includes JWT in requests.
- **Backend API (Spring Boot):**  
  - Exposes RESTful endpoints for product management, user authentication, dynamic pricing, filtering/search, and order processing.
  - Performs dynamic pricing adjustments based on selected laptop specifications.
  - Handles role-based access control (admin/user) using JWT tokens.
- **Database (MySQL):**  
  - Stores users, products, orders, inventory, and pricing rules.
- **Authentication (JWT):**  
  - On login, backend issues JWT, which the frontend stores and attaches to API requests.
- **Containerization (Docker):**  
  - Backend is packaged in a Docker container for easy deployment and environment consistency.

- **Entities:** User, Role, Laptop, LaptopSpec, LaptopColor, SelectedLaptopSpec, CartItem, WishList, Order, OrderItem, EmailSubscription

**Relationships:**

- A **User** can have multiple **Roles** (many-to-many), and a **Role** can be assigned to multiple **Users**.
- A **User** can have multiple **CartItems**, **WishList** entries, and **Orders** (one-to-many relationships).
- Each **CartItem** references a **User**, a **Laptop**, and a **SelectedLaptopSpec** (many-to-one).
- Each **WishList** entry references a **User** and a **Laptop** (many-to-one).
- Each **Order** is placed by a **User** and can contain multiple **OrderItems** (one-to-many with **OrderItem**).
- Each **OrderItem** references an **Order**, a **Laptop**, and a **SelectedLaptopSpec**.
- A **Laptop** can have multiple **LaptopSpecs** (one-to-many), multiple **LaptopColors** (one-to-many), and can be referenced by multiple **CartItems**, **OrderItems**, **WishList** entries, and **SelectedLaptopSpecs**.
- Each **LaptopSpec** and **LaptopColor** references a **Laptop** (many-to-one).
- Each **SelectedLaptopSpec** references a **Laptop** and can be associated with multiple **CartItems** and **OrderItems**.
- **EmailSubscription** stores email addresses for marketing and is not directly linked to other entities.
